# chromance-customcode
Custom code for a project based on Chromance by Zach Freedman

Made for Arduino nano and WS2811 led strips using FastLED library (https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)
Can light up up to 10 separate led sections at the same time.

It is and it will probably work in progress.
It's only here to document my progress as a developer.
